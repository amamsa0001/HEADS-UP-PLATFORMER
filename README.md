# HEADS-UP-PLATFORMER

For image manipulation using Krita I added caps to all the sprites to make the game a little different, its named after a store

For Map Manipulation I added mushrooms after a friend I call mushroom and made the water lava

For character manipulation I changed the speed of the character to make him speedy, using Copilot I also added support for WASD support so now you can use WASD and are NOT limted to only arrow keys and space
